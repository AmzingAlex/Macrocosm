# Macrocosm
Experience what Minecraft could be in a couple of years!

 

Welcome to Macrocosm, a vanilla plus modpack with its core values focused on exploration, optimization, rewards, and seamless multiplayer! This modpack will recieve content updates, and will always be ported to the newest version (when all the mods are available). The goal of this modpack is to add a bunch of new content to the game, while still having it feel like you're playing Minecraft with your friends.

 

Currently there is a 1.18.2 and 1.19.2 version. I highly recommend the 1.19.2 version as it's overall a lot better optimized and stable.
